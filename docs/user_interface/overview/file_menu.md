# File Menu

The `File` menu in the top menu bar contains five options:

## New

Clears all content and closes the current opened file.

## Open...

Opens a file chooser, where an existing ontology json file can be opened.

## Import...

Opens a file chooser to allow selecting an existing ontology json. All contents of the selected file will be imported
and added to the file that is currently opened in the browser. Allows merging multiple files, the one selected for
import will remain unchanged.

## Save

Saves all changes made in the browser to the currently open file. When no file is opened, for example when creating
a new ontology, `Save As...` is used instead.

## Save As...

Opens a file chooser to enter a filename to create a new file, or select an existing json to overwrite,
where the current ontology will be saved to. The selected file will then be set as the currently opened file in the
browser.
